# Example cloud configuration
# This shows what a typical configuration looks like
# Copy to clouds.yaml and customize for your setup

clouds:
  # Example: Google Drive primary account
  - name: "Google Drive Main"
    rclone_remote: "gdrive_main"    # Must match output of: rclone listremotes
    root: ""                         # "" = scan entire remote, or specify subfolder like "Documents"
    include_shared: false            # Set to true to include "Shared with me" files
    
  # Example: OneDrive personal account
  - name: "OneDrive Personal"
    rclone_remote: "onedrive"
    root: ""
    include_shared: false
    
  # Example: Dropbox account
  - name: "Dropbox"
    rclone_remote: "dropbox"
    root: ""
    include_shared: false
    
  # Example: Google Drive secondary account (e.g., work account)
  - name: "Google Drive Work"
    rclone_remote: "gdrive_work"
    root: ""
    include_shared: true             # Include shared folders from teammates
    
  # Example: Scanning only a specific folder
  - name: "Google Drive Photos Only"
    rclone_remote: "gdrive_main"
    root: "Photos"                   # Only scan the Photos folder
    include_shared: false

# Tips:
# - Remove or comment out clouds you don't have configured
# - The order doesn't matter
# - You can add the same remote multiple times with different 'root' paths
# - Use 'rclone listremotes' to see your configured remotes
