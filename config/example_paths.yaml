# Example paths configuration
# Copy to paths.yaml and customize for your setup

# Where to save JSON manifests from rclone lsjson
# Each cloud will create one .json file here
manifests_dir: "./manifests"

# Where to save logs (optional, not currently used by all scripts)
logs_dir: "./logs"

# Where to save DuckDB database (for future use)
database_path: "./clouds.duckdb"

# Tips:
# - Use relative paths (starting with ./) for portability
# - Or use absolute paths like "C:/Users/YourName/clouds-data/manifests"
# - Directories will be created automatically if they don't exist
